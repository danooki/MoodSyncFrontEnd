# Frontend Routing Test Documentation

## Current Routing Setup

The application now has proper handling for invalid/incorrect routes. Here's how it works:

### Valid Routes

- `/` → redirects to `/profile`
- `/login` → shows Login component (if not authenticated)
- `/register` → shows Register component (if not authenticated)
- `/profile` → shows ProfileLayout (if authenticated)

### Invalid Routes (NEW!)

- `/asdasd` → redirects to `/login` (if not authenticated) or `/profile` (if authenticated)
- `/invalid-page` → redirects to `/login` (if not authenticated) or `/profile` (if authenticated)
- Any other invalid path → redirects based on authentication status

## How It Works

1. **ErrorBoundary Component**: A separate component (`src/components/ErrorBoundary.jsx`) handles any route that doesn't match the defined patterns
2. **Authentication Check**: Uses the `useAuth` hook to determine if a user is logged in
3. **Smart Redirect**:
   - If user is authenticated → redirects to `/profile`
   - If user is not authenticated → redirects to `/login`
4. **Loading State**: Shows a loading spinner while checking authentication status

## Implementation Details

The error handling is now organized in a clean, modular way:

- **`App.jsx`**: Contains only the main routing logic and imports the ErrorBoundary
- **`ErrorBoundary.jsx`**: Handles all invalid route logic and redirects
- **Separation of Concerns**: Error handling is completely separated from the main app routing

The catch-all route is implemented using React Router's `path="*"` pattern:

```jsx
{
  /* Catch-all route for invalid paths */
}
<Route path="*" element={<ErrorBoundary />} />;
```

## Benefits of This Structure

1. **Cleaner App.jsx**: Main routing logic is focused and easy to read
2. **Reusable Component**: ErrorBoundary can be used elsewhere if needed
3. **Better Testing**: Error handling logic can be tested independently
4. **Maintainability**: Easier to modify error handling behavior without touching main routing
5. **Separation of Concerns**: Each component has a single responsibility

## Testing

To test this functionality:

1. Start the development server: `npm run dev`
2. Try navigating to invalid routes like:
   - `/asdasd`
   - `/invalid-page`
   - `/random-text`
3. Verify that you get redirected to either `/login` or `/profile` based on your authentication status

The error handling now works exactly the same but with a much cleaner, more maintainable code structure.
